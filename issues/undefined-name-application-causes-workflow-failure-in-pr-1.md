### Issue: Undefined name 'Application' causes workflow failure in PR #1

#### Description:
The workflow for Pull Request #1 (https://github.com/socrates965/dvpwa/pull/1) failed due to a Python syntax error:

```
app: Application = request.app
         ^
F821 undefined name 'Application'
```

This means the name 'Application' was not imported in the affected file. To resolve, add this import to the top of the file:

```python
from aiohttp.web import Application
```

#### Summary of PR and Job Failure:
- PR #1 introduces changes but the CI workflow failed during syntax check.
- The failure is caused by an undefined name error for 'Application'.
- Fixing the import will allow the PR to pass automated checks.
